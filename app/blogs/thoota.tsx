        Welcome to our farm! As someone from an agriculturist family,
        farming is not just a livelihood for us—it's a way of life.
        Our farm, located in the beautiful village of <strong>Mutuguppe, Karnataka</strong>,
        is home to a variety of crops that we have nurtured for generations.

        <p className="mt-2">
          On our farm, we cultivate a diverse range of crops.
          Here's a glimpse of what we grow:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4">
          <li className="mt-2">Arecanut (our traditional crop)</li>
          <li className="mt-2">Black Pepper</li>
          <li className="mt-2">Rubber</li>
          <li className="mt-2">Coffee</li>
          <li className="mt-2">Fruits and Vegetables (for our household)</li>

        <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Arecanut – Our Legacy</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The cultivation of <strong>Arecanut</strong> is deeply rooted in our
          family's history. This tall tree crop can grow up
          to 50-80 feet, and harvesting it is an art in itself.
          Skilled workers climb these trees to carefully pluck the arecanuts,
          a tradition passed down through generations.
          Known for its use in various cultural and medicinal contexts,
          Arecanut has been the backbone of our farming heritage.

        <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Black Pepper – The King of Spices</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Black Pepper</strong>, often called the 'King of Spices', is one of the most widely used spices globally. We grow this vine-based crop on our farm, using traditional methods. Its cultivation requires careful nurturing, and the peppercorns are hand-harvested when they ripen, adding a distinct flavor and aroma to our harvest.

      <section className="mt-6">
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">Rubber – The Versatile Crop</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Rubber</strong> is another key crop on our farm. We tap the rubber trees for latex, which is processed into rubber—a vital material for many industries, including manufacturing tires, footwear, and medical supplies. Our farm plays a small but significant role in contributing to this sustainable resource.
